Howdy, We're Citrus-CAF
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Citrus-CAF, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/initializing).


To initialize your local repository for MSM8953 and other unlisted devices, use this command:


	repo init -u git://github.com/Citrus-CAF/manifest.git -b n7x -m citrus-caf.xml



Time to sync up our shit! [I love this part]:

	repo sync -c -f -j8 --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags

Compiling the source!
---------------------
	. makelemonade.sh $device

(You can use additional flags along with $device, i.e `. makelemonade.sh kenzo sync clean log shutdown` to sync before build, make clean and save log of build and shutdown after build complete.)

##### Else, build it manually with
	mka lemonade -j#

Don't worry about the name! We're not as sour as we sound! That gadget, over there, right in your arms, might die tasting citrus xD

JK!
